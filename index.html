        Mayfair strange in the morning light
        Mayfair strange in the summer night
        Mayfair strangest in the afternoon
        Mayfair stretching far above
        Full of fame but lacking love
        Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?

        Mayfair strange across the park
        In the day or in the dark
        There's no need to walk or even run
        Mayfair faces clean and nice
        But beauty here is cold as ice
        Could it be we see the Mayfair sun?

        Mayfair strange at every hour
        Hidden frowns with mystic power
        Starry heights and golden throne
        Down below you're on your own

        Mayfair strange for passers-by
        Sights of wonder for the eye
        Could it be that they'll pass by again?
        Mayfair calling far and near
        For even trees are wealthy here
        Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain?

        Mayfair strange in the morning light
        Mayfair strange in the summer night
        Mayfair strangest in the afternoon
        Mayfair stretching far above
        Full of fame but lacking love
        Could it be we see the Mayfair moon?
